### Decription

We intend to create an interactive representation of the etymology of the english dictionary.
The global design idea would be to have an interactive graph of the etymology (nodes:=words, links:=etymology or derived form) along with a navigational search part to look for the etymology of a specific word/ look for the words derived from one common root.
The goal is to nicely visualize the complex intertwining of the different languages and to highlight the various origins of the english language.
